# redstoneplus
A fabric mod which improves redstone in a vanilla way.

-----

## Features

### Blocks

- Coloured lamps. Craft a redstone lamp with any dye (apart from black, brown, or grey)
- Remembator. Has 3 set sides, and one reset side. This will remember the strength powered from a set side
- Player sensor. Will output a signal strength equal to the number of players within 5 blocks.
- Weather sensor. Has two modes: rain and thunder. It also needs sky access (duh)
- Uninverted torch. Like a redstone torch, but doesn't invert the signal. Useful for powering up (and down, see Utilities)

### Tweaks
- Repeaters and comparators will now give comparator output on their sides
- Redstone and uninverted torches can be placed on the undersides of blocks, working as expected
